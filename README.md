# 🧠🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository showcases multiple **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects focused on real-world applications like **language detection**, **speech synthesis**, and **web scraping** of textual data. The aim is to demonstrate how NLP techniques can be used to process, understand, and generate human language effectively.

## 📚 What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It powers a wide range of applications such as chatbots, translators, search engines, sentiment analysis tools, and voice assistants.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 🌍 1. Multi-language Detection & Speaking
- Detects the language of the input text automatically
- Translates text into a selected target language
- Uses **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** to convert text to audio
- Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu, etc.)

### 🌐 2. NLP-Based Web Scraping
- Scrapes text content from websites or news pages
- Cleans and tokenizes the text using **NLTK**
- Visualizes word frequency and generates a **WordCloud**
- Detects language and extracts meaningful keywords
